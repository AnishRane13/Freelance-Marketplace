hey, I need an help

I have an web app in postgres, node and react. In which I have company and user 
Company will buy subscriptions suppose like 100 rupees for 2 jobs and 500 for 10 jobs. 
For that I will just open a payment gateway of paypal sandbox and will make the payment and store the subscription and jobs in the DB, so for this I dont have to any
financial information from the company.
Now a company creates a job and user completes it, so company has to pay user through my web app.
For company I can again directly open payment gateway directly on a button click without taking their financial information beforehand
but when I have to the user from my app, how can I do it, I have no clue, do I need to take any financial information from them or what ? I have no idea


-- 5th March 2025 -- 
In this code what I have to implement is only company would be able to create jobs for freelancers[users]
Company first needs to buy a subscription to create jobs such as I am using paypal sandbox for the payment subscriptions are like for 100 rs - 2 jobs for 500 - 10 jobs etc.
each job will have price attached to it suppose 4000 rupees and each job will have category attached to it and other important details for the jobs
User who have that category selected would be able to see that job posts.
If user feels that job is good for him then he will quote it. Company will receive all the quotes by the users and will select the one which they feel is correct.


In this I want to add another functionality Such that, if user quotes a price and company accepts it then user will receive an pdf as an agreement. If user accepts it's terms and conditions then only job is assigned to that user, so give me schema properly

Now in this after the job's date is passed and the company can mark job as completed then the company have to the quoted amount to my application and I will show it on the user's profile as the total amount collected by doing all the jobs
